============

Higher Priority
---------------

Need less annoying music for the title screen.
Need to finish implementing and testing all enemy types.
Need a sound effect each time player fires their thruster.
Visuals for enemies are seemingly being rendered upside down sometimes.
Planet should be shown (and heard) exploding when the last habitat is destroyed.
A minimap should be added that shows the entire planet, the habitats, and the enemies.
Gathering of initials for leaderboard doesn't work yet.
Sometimes enemies carrying habitats are impossible to hit; across the wrap boundary?
Sometimes explosions do not appear, perhaps the visuals are not wrapped?
Shots should not collide with (and thus destroy) other shots.
Should enemy shots hurt enemies?
If the player collides with the last raider, the level will never end.

Lower Priority
--------------
Need a producer sound effect for This Could Be Better.
Control style would probably be better if Dark instead of Default.
Title screen should cycle through several screens, including instructions and high scores.
Habitats dropped from too high should be destroyed?
Habitats hit by projectiles should be destroyed?
Need to implement smart bombs, and show the remaining count?
Need to implement hyperspace shunt?
